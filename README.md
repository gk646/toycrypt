`toycrypt` is an educational crypto library that implements common algorithms and attack scenarios from scratch.
It focuses on understandable and documented code and operates only on a limited space.

It features:

- Many **math primitives** from modular arithmetic like _gcd, lcm and extended euler_
- Multiple **hash functions and their common attacks**
- **XOR encryption** and decryption
- **Geometric progression conversion** to/from any base (hexadecimal, octal, binary, ...)
- Network simulation and eavesdropping

Roadmap:

- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
- Digital Signatures
- Man-in-the-middle Attack
