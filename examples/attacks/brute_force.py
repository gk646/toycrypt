# Brute Force Attack
# Topics: Hashing, Passwords

# A brute force attack focuses on finding an input that produces a specific hash value (a so-called preimage)
# This is helpful as usually for password authentication you store only the hash of the password (not in plain text)
# If you can now find any input that computes to the same hash you can authenticate yourself without knowing the real password
# Note: A brute-force attack is similar to a pre-image attacks, but you do not try to exploit any weakness.
#       It relies solely on trying all possible inputs (exhaustive search).

# Known:
#   - The password hash (e.g. stolen from a database)
#   - The hash function used
# Hidden:
#   - The original password string
# Wanted:
#   - Any input string that hashes to the same value as the original password
